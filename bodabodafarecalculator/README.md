# ðŸ›µ Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator

This is a simple JavaScript project I built as part of a coding challenge. It helps estimate the cost of a boda boda ride in Kenya based on the distance you travel.

Iâ€™m currently learning how to build projects in JavaScript, and this challenge helped me practice how to:

- Prompt users for input
- Do calculations with variables
- Handle invalid input using conditions
- Format output nicely with `console.log()`

---

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

1. The user is asked:  
   **"Unafika wapi mkubwa? Kilometre ngapi?:"**
2. They enter the number of kilometers.
3. The app calculates the total fare using:
   - Base fare: **KES 50**
   - Charge per km: **KES 15**
4. It prints a clear breakdown of the fare.

## ðŸ“Œ Example

If the user enters `5`, hereâ€™s what the console shows:

Uko kwote? Io ni 5 km:
Ukikalia Pikipiki: KES 50
Mpaka Uko: KES 75
Total: KES 125

Panda Pikipiki!

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to use `prompt()` and `Number()` to get user input
- How to check for invalid input with `isNaN()` and conditionals
- How to break down real-world problems into code logic
- How to write readable output to the console

---

## ðŸ”§ How To Run It

You can test the code by:

1. Opening it in a browser console (like Chrome DevTools).
2. Or using an online editor like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).
3. When prompted, enter any number of kilometers to see the estimated fare.

## ðŸ’¬ Why I Wrote This README

I wrote this README myself to help me remember what the project does, how it works, and what I learned. Iâ€™m still learning, so keeping notes like this helps a lot â€” and I hope it shows that I understand what Iâ€™m building.
